# 17-multifetcher: Multi-Source Content Fetching (Placeholder)

## üìç Module Status

This module directory is currently a placeholder. The multifetcher implementation has been moved to:

**‚û°Ô∏è [18-multifetcher](../18-multifetcher)**

## üéØ What is MultiFetcher?

MultiFetcher is a sophisticated content retrieval system that:
- **Combines Multiple Sources**: Fetch content from HTTP, GraphSync, Bitswap, and other protocols
- **Intelligent Racing**: Race multiple sources and use the fastest response
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic fallback when sources fail
- **Performance Optimization**: Choose optimal retrieval strategies
- **Provider Integration**: Works with IPNI for provider discovery

## üîó Implementation Location

The complete MultiFetcher implementation including:
- Core fetching logic
- HTTP fetcher implementation
- Multi-source coordination
- Comprehensive tests
- Usage examples

Can be found in: **[18-multifetcher](../18-multifetcher)**
